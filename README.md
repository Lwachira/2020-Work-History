# 2020-Work-History


 > **Sadly due to complicated legal requirement's I am not allowed to share the source code from [2016](https://github.com/Lwachira/2016-Internship), [2018](https://github.com/Lwachira/2018-Work-History), [2019](https://github.com/Lwachira/2019-Work-History) with you. If you wish to pursue this further, we should chat, I can explain all the interesting things I built over the last 3 years**.

## What is this?

The work here is a representation of the work I did in 2020. This was different from previous both what was going on with the world in 2020 as well as my personal growth that same year. If 2019 was the year I learnt and grew more so than ever, 2020 was the year those new hard worn skills became more refined and polished. 

I have 7 applications currently running and being used in the company. 2 of those are user facing programs in the form of a Jquery Application as well as an asp blazor application.
